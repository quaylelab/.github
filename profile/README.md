## üéì Welcome to the Quayle Lab GitHub Organization!

The Quayle Lab is dedicated to cutting-edge research in **cancer bioinformatics**, with a focus on leveraging computational methods to understand and combat cancer. This organization serves as a centralised hub for all research projects conducted by members of the lab, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and collaborators.

## üß¨ About Us

Our lab combines expertise in **bioinformatics, genomics, data science**, and **machine learning** to analyse large-scale cancer datasets. We are committed to contributing to the scientific community through open-source research, code, and collaborative projects that aim to unravel the complexities of cancer biology.

## üåü Purpose of This Organisation

The primary goals of this GitHub organisation are:

- **Centralising Research**: Provide a common platform for all lab members to share and manage their research code, data, and findings.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration among lab members, as well as with external collaborators and the broader scientific community.
- **Transparency & Reproducibility**: Promote transparent, reproducible research by sharing code, data, and documentation in an open-access format.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each repository within this organisation represents a **distinct project** within the Quayle Lab. For example:

- `project-name-phd-student`: Project repositories for PhD students
- `common-tools`: Repositories for shared tools, scripts, or pipelines used by the lab
- `collaborative-projects`: Joint projects with other labs or research groups

## üìë Guidelines for Lab Members

If you are a member of the Quayle Lab, please adhere to the following guidelines when working within this GitHub organisation:

### 1. Creating a New Repository
- Each project should have its **own repository**. Use a consistent naming format: `project-title_studentname` (e.g., `tumor-genomics_janedoe`).
- Include a README file in your repository that provides:
  - An overview of your project
  - Objectives
  - Methodology
  - How to use/replicate your analyses
  - Contact details

### 2. Version Control & Branching
- Use **meaningful commit messages** that describe changes made.
- Work within branches when developing new features or analyses, and **merge back into `main`** only after thorough testing.

### 3. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Provide clear, detailed documentation for your code, including comments, usage instructions, and any necessary dependencies.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown, or similar tools to create reproducible workflows when possible.
- Store data responsibly, ensuring that sensitive or large datasets are not included in the repository. Instead, provide instructions on how to access or download them.

### 4. Collaboration & Contribution
- Collaborate with other members by reviewing pull requests, providing feedback, and sharing ideas.
- Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, suggest enhancements, or discuss aspects of your project.

## üì¨ Contact & Communication

For any questions about this organisation or if you need access, please contact **Dr Lewis A Quayle** at l.quayle@shu.ac.uk.

We encourage collaboration, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute or have an idea for a new project!

## ü§ù Acknowledgements

Thank you to all the members of the Quayle Lab for your dedication to advancing cancer bioinformatics research. Together, we can make significant strides in understanding and treating cancer.
